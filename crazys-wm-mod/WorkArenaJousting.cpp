	General plan is to at some point make it to where u have a jousting tourment ever week.  More girls the better
	have them place and 1st place thru 3rd get the most money.  How they place would be based off job performance.
	If they have the same lvl of jobperformance then have a random roll to see who wins.  More girls in it mean more
	people show up to watch it and would mean more money.  Not sure how to do this yet but its more or less the basic
	ideal.*/
