	/*
	*	WD:	Modified to fix customer service problems.. I hope :)
	*
	*	Change logic as original code is based on linked list of customers
	*	not random generation for each call to GetCustomer()
	*
	*	Pricing issues seem to be resolved with getting lots of money
	*	from customer that cant pay
	*
	*	The numbers I have added need to be tested
	*
	*	Limit number customers a girl can fuck to 10 max
	*
	*	Limit the number of customers a girl can see if they will
	*	fuck her from 5 to Max Customers * 2
	*
	*	Redid the code for deadbeat customers
	*
	*	% Chance of customers without any money getting service is
	*  percent(50 - INTELLIGENCE) / 5) where  20 < INTELLIGENCE < 100
	*	If caught will set deadbeat flag
	*
	*	GetCustomer() is generating a lot of poor customers changed
	*	code to add pay to customers funds instead of generating
	*	New customer.
	*
	*	% Chance of customer refusing to pay despite having funds is
	*	percent((40 - HAPPINESS) / 2) && percent(CONFIDENCE - 25)
	*	If caught by guards they will pay
	*
	*	Only decrement filthiness when service is performed in brothel
	*
	*	Street Work will not decrement number customers
	*  Street work will only service 66% number of customers
	*	Street Work will only generate 66% of brothel income
	*	Street Work Really needs its own NumCustomers() counter
	*
	*	Rival gangs can damage girls doing Street Work
	*  % Chance of destroying rival gang is depended on best of
	*	SKILL_COMBAT & SKILL_MAGIC / 5
	*
	*	Changed message for rival gangs attacking street girls to give
	*	EVENT_WARNING
	*
	*	GROUP sex code caculations now consolidated to one place
	*
	*  Fixed end of shift messages
	*
	*	Fame only to be done in GirlFucks()
	*
	*	Now Base Customer HAPPINESS = 60, code conslidated from 2 places in file
	*
